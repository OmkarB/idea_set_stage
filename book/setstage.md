#Welcome to the Set stage! 

The objective of the Set stage in IDEA is to take your product or service and commercialize it. To do this you will need to create a process that is designed to generate revenue either directly from customers or from other sources like partnerships or advertisements. This process will include developing, selling and supporting your product or service for customers. 

This stage in IDEA is about:
* Your business model
* Developing a Minimum Viable Product/Service
* A comprehensive Go-to-Market strategy
* Beginning to understand your legal structure
