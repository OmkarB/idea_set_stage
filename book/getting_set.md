#Getting started

Objective of the Set stage in IDEA is to take your product or service and commercialize it. To do this you will need to create a process that is designed to generate revenue either directly from customers or from other sources like partnerships or advertisements. This process will include developing, selling and supporting your product or service for customers. 
To help you with your venture development in the Set stage IDEA has developed a [Set Stage Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E-IYyc3LAZ03tlZICg-HyFxPOH2zjpbj4nIt4SxpS34/edit). 

Resources available to Set stage ventures:
* One-on-one coach
* In-kind Service Providers
* Mentorship
* Entrepreneur in Residence
* Workshops/Events
* Prototype fund
