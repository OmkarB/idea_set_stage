###In-kind Service Providers
IDEA works closely with a group of local firms to provide in-kind services to ventures. Our network of service providers expands over a number of industries, including finance, law, marketing, public relations, and technology.

Before requesting legal help you should first have your ventures reach out to IDEA’s legal officer to schedule a time to meet. Ventures can fill out [this form](https://www.tfaforms.com/390675) to get in touch with the legal officer.
